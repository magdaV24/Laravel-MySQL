# Online store built with Laravel and MySQL

## Overview

A Laravel framework project using a MySQL database, including features such as: user authentication, adding products to the store, adding products to a wishlist or a shopping cart, leaving reviews and comments, placing orders.

## Functionality

In order to use the store, an account is needed. To Laravel's authentication feature, I have added the option to add a profile picture and gave the users roles. An user asigned with an admin role has the ability to add, edit and remove products from the store. They also can change the orders' statuses, in order to keep the buyer informed. A normal user can add and remove products from the cart or from the wishlist. They also can add/delete their addresses, place orders and leave/edit/delete reviews and comments on the products' pages. Any user can edit or remove their own account.
